ToDo:
2. another thing that I was thinking to ask you - is whether it would be ok for you to maybe set up a git/github repository,
so that we could better collaborate and I could also have, for example, always the latest version of the code
(however this is just an idea - we can discuss better about that)

3. I agree that the ERDS maps seem a little bit suspicious... could it be that there are some "NaN" in the matrices to be plotted?
Or that maybe the colormap axis is not appropriate and everything is "saturated" to the highest value so red?

5. in the PSD plots, not sure whether I would display then in dB - maybe the linear scale is better?


... and, one could try to do all this (1) + 2) + 3)) twice, one aligned to the cue, and once aligned to the
"end of instructions", where the instruction durations are:

foot 2.8 s
hand 2.7 s
rest 2.6 s
