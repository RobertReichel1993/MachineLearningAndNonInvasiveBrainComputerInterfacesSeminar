ToDo:

- try to do some classification in time-domain (MRCPs) as follows:

         - look at significantly different time points (like in NBCI1 Unit1&2), to decide on a "reasonable" time window to try classification, for all electrodes

         - compose the feature vector using the amplitude information (of the signal sampled at 10Hz), in the defined time-window, for all electrodes
(so for example, if you have a window of 1s --> will be 10 samples --> which means that in total the feature vector will be 10xnchannels dimensional)

         - train sLDA model

         - cross-validation to estimate the accuracy



For later... to think ahead:

- paper with ideas to combine time-domain and frequency features:

... and, one could try to do all this (1) + 2) + 3)) twice, one aligned to the cue, and once aligned to the
"end of instructions", where the instruction durations are:

foot 2.8 s
hand 2.7 s
rest 2.6 s
