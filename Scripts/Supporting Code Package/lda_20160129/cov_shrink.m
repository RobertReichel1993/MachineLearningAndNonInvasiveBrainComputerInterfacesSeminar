function [S,lam] = cov_shrink(X,w)
% Estimate the covariance matrix for some data using analytical shrinkage.
% Sigma = cov_shrink(X,w)
%
% This gives robust estimates even when the ratio of number of observations to number of variables is very low. [1]
%
% X is a matrix where each row is an observation, and each column is a 
% variable. The mean is removed from each column before calculating the
% result. The estimate is unbiased, i.e. cov_shrink normalizes by N-1.
%
% w is an optional [Nx1] vector of nonnegative weights.
